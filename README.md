My internet connection has become... unreliable. This is going to be a bit of a hack job to eventually capture and log when pings drop, etc. so that I have a starting point when attempting to resolve the issues with the ISP.

This may or may not work for you and you should be under no expectation that it will. Do whatever with it; I care not. What you do however is not my problem nor my responsibility. We are all adults, right?
